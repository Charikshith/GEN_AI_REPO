## Understanding the Difference Between “is” and “==” in Python

When working with Python, understanding the distinction between the `is` operator and the `==` operator is crucial for writing robust and predictable code. In this section, we’ll explore the differences between these two operators, why mixing them up can lead to unexpected behavior, and provide clear examples to illustrate their usage.

### When to Use “is”

The `is` operator checks for **identity**, meaning it determines whether two variables refer to the same object in memory. It does not check for equality in value but rather whether both variables point to the exact same memory location.

Here’s an example to demonstrate this:

```python
a = 500
b = 500

print(id(a))  # Output: something like 140720195786112
print(id(b))  # Output: might be the same or different depending on Python's optimization

print(a is b)  # This might return True or False
```

In Python, due to internal optimizations, small integers (like 500) might be cached and reused, so `a is b` could return `True`. However, for larger integers or other types, this is not guaranteed.

### When to Use “==”

The `==` operator checks for **equality**, meaning it evaluates whether the values of two variables are the same. This is the operator you should use when you want to check if the contents of two variables are identical.

Here’s an example using a custom class to illustrate this:

```python
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name, calories):
        self.name = name
        self.calories = calories

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__

fruit_a = Fruit("banana", 10)
fruit_b = Fruit("banana", 10)

print(fruit_a == fruit_b)  # Output: True
print(fruit_a is fruit_b)   # Output: False
```

In this example, `fruit_a` and `fruit_b` are two separate instances of the `Fruit` class. They have the same values, so `fruit_a == fruit_b` returns `True`. However, since they are different objects in memory, `fruit_a is fruit_b` returns `False`.

### Key Examples to Illustrate the Difference

#### Example 1: Integer Comparison

```python
a = 1000
b = 1000

print(id(a))  # Output: something like 140720195786112
print(id(b))  # Output: might be different

print(a == b)  # Output: True
print(a is b)  # Output: False (usually)
```

Here, `a` and `b` have the same value, so `a == b` is `True`. However, they are different objects in memory, so `a is b` is `False`.

#### Example 2: Object Comparison

```python
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name, calories):
        self.name = name
        self.calories = calories

fruit_a = Fruit("apple", 50)
fruit_b = Fruit("apple", 50)

print(fruit_a == fruit_b)  # Output: True (if __eq__ is properly defined)
print(fruit_a is fruit_b)  # Output: False
```

In this example, `fruit_a` and `fruit_b` are two different instances of the `Fruit` class. They have the same attributes, so they are equal, but they are not the same object in memory.

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Use `==` for Value Comparison**: Always use the `==` operator when you want to check if two variables have the same value. This is the standard way to compare values in Python.

2. **Use `is` for Identity Checks**: Use the `is` operator only when you need to check if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. This is useful for checking if a variable is `None` or for other identity checks.

3. **Avoid Using `is` for Value Comparison**: Never use `is` to compare values, especially for integers. Due to Python’s optimization, small integers might return `True` when using `is`, but this behavior is not reliable and can lead to unexpected results.

4. **Be Cautious with Small Integers**: Python internally caches small integers (like numbers between -5 and 256) for optimization purposes. This means that `a is b` might return `True` for small integers even if they are different variables. However, this behavior is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon.

5. **Use `is not` Instead of `!=` for Identity Checks**: When checking if two variables are not the same object, use `is not` instead of `!=`. For example, `x is not y` is more efficient and clearer than `x != y` for identity checks.

### Conclusion

In summary, the `is` operator checks for identity (whether two variables refer to the same object in memory), while the `==` operator checks for equality (whether two variables have the same value). Mixing these two concepts can lead to unexpected behavior in your programs. Always use `==` for value comparisons and reserve `is` for identity checks.

By following these guidelines and understanding the difference between `is` and `==`, you’ll write more predictable and robust Python code.

## 002 Lambda Functions



## Understanding Lambda Functions in Python

Lambda functions, often referred to as anonymous functions, are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to define small, one-time use functions without declaring them with a name. These functions are useful for short, simple operations and can make your code more concise and readable when used appropriately.

### What Are Lambda Functions?

Lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are called "anonymous" because they are not declared with a name. Instead, they are defined inline within your code. Here’s a basic example of a lambda function:

```python
square = lambda a: a ** 2
print(square(4))  # Outputs: 16
print(square(5))  # Outputs: 25
```

In this example, `lambda a: a ** 2` is a lambda function that takes a single argument `a` and returns `a` squared. The function is then assigned to the variable `square`, which can be used like a regular function.

### Why Use Lambda Functions?

Lambda functions are particularly useful in situations where you need a short, one-time use function. They are especially handy when working with higher-order functions like `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`, which expect a function as an argument.

#### Example: Using Lambda with `filter()`

Suppose we have a list of numbers and we want to filter out the even numbers. We can use a lambda function with the `filter()` function to achieve this:

```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
even_numbers: list[int] = list(filter(lambda a: a % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Outputs: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, the lambda function `lambda a: a % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even. The `filter()` function applies this lambda function to each element in the list and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

### Assigning Lambda Functions to Variables

While lambda functions are anonymous by nature, you can assign them to variables, effectively giving them a name. This allows you to reuse the function as needed:

```python
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(5, 3))  # Outputs: 8
```

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Keep It Simple**: Lambda functions are best suited for simple operations. Avoid using them for complex logic, as this can make your code harder to read and debug.

2. **Use for Short Operations**: If you need a function that will be used once and in one place, consider using a lambda function to save space and improve readability.

3. **Readability is Key**: While lambda functions can make your code concise, they should still be readable. Avoid writing overly complex lambda functions that are difficult to understand at a glance.

4. **Assign to Variables When Needed**: If you find yourself using the same lambda function in multiple places, consider assigning it to a variable to make your code more maintainable.

5. **Avoid Overcomplication**: Don’t force yourself to use lambda functions just for the sake of using them. If the function is too complex or requires multiple lines of code, it’s better to use a regular function definition.

### Additional Information

- **Using Lambda with `map()`**: Lambda functions can also be used with the `map()` function to apply a transformation to each element of an iterable.

  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  squared_numbers = list(map(lambda a: a ** 2, numbers))
  print(squared_numbers)  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
  ```

- **Using Lambda with `reduce()`**: The `reduce()` function from the `functools` module can also utilize lambda functions to apply cumulative operations.

  ```python
  from functools import reduce
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  product = reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, numbers)
  print(product)  # Outputs: 120
  ```

- **Multi-Parameter Lambda Functions**: Lambda functions can accept multiple parameters, making them versatile for a variety of tasks.

  ```python
  greet = lambda name, age: f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
  print(greet("John", 30))  # Outputs: Hello, John! You are 30 years old.
  ```

### Conclusion

Lambda functions are a powerful tool in Python that can simplify your code and make it more concise. However, they should be used judiciously and only when appropriate. Remember to keep your lambda functions simple, readable, and focused on performing a single task. With practice, you’ll become adept at knowing when to use lambda functions to enhance your code.

# 003 Walrus Operator



## The Walrus Operator in Python: A Game-Changer for Cleaner Code

Python 3.8 introduced a powerful feature known as the **walrus operator** (`:=`), which has been a game-changer for developers. This operator allows you to assign values to variables within expressions, making your code cleaner and more concise. In this section, we’ll explore how to use the walrus operator effectively, with practical examples and tips to help you make the most out of it.

---

### What is the Walrus Operator?

The walrus operator, `:=`, is a new assignment operator in Python that enables you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. It’s called the walrus operator because `:=` resembles the eyes and tusks of a walrus. This feature is particularly useful when you need to use the result of an expression multiple times or when you want to simplify your code by reducing redundancy.

---

Here's a super simple example comparing code with and without the walrus operator (`:=`):

#### Without Walrus Operator
```python
# We want to check if a number is greater than 10, then print it
number = 15

if number > 10:
    print(f"{number} is greater than 10")
```

#### With Walrus Operator
```python
# Same check but using walrus operator
if (number := 15) > 10:
    print(f"{number} is greater than 10")
```

#### Key difference explained:
1. **Without walrus**:
   - We first assign the value to `number`
   - Then we check `number > 10`

2. **With walrus**:
   - We combine assignment and check in one line
   - `(number := 15)` does two things:
     * Assigns 15 to `number`
     * Passes the value (15) to the comparison `> 10`

#### More practical example: Checking user input

**Without walrus:**
```python
user_input = input("Enter 'yes' or 'no': ")
if user_input == "yes":
    print("You said YES!")
```

**With walrus:**
```python
if (user_input := input("Enter 'yes' or 'no': ")) == "yes":
    print("You said YES!")
```

#### Why it's useful:
1. **Combines two steps into one**:
   - Assignment + comparison in a single line

2. **Avoids repeating variable names**:
   - Don't need to mention `user_input` twice

3. **Keeps code concise**:
   - Especially useful in conditionals and loops

4. **Prevents creating variables before they're needed**:
   - The variable only exists within the conditional block

#### Real analogy:
Think of it like this:
- **Without walrus**: "Bring me a glass of water. Then I'll check if it's cold."
- **With walrus**: "Bring me a glass of water and check if it's cold at the same time."

The walrus operator helps you do the assignment ("getting the water") and the check ("is it cold?") in one action!

### Example 1: Using the Walrus Operator in a Function

Let’s dive into an example to see how the walrus operator works. Suppose we want to create a function called `get_info` that analyzes a given string and returns a dictionary with information such as the text itself, the number of letters, the number of words, and the average number of letters per word.

```python
def get_info(text: str) -> dict:
    return {
        "text": text,
        "letters": (length := len(text.replace(" ", ""))),
        "words": (words := text.split()),
        "word_length": (word_length := len(words)),
        "average_per_word": round(length / word_length, 2)
    }
```

In this example:

1. `length := len(text.replace(" ", ""))` calculates the number of letters in the text (excluding spaces) and assigns it to the variable `length`.
2. `words := text.split()` splits the text into words and assigns the result to the variable `words`.
3. `word_length := len(words)` calculates the number of words and assigns it to the variable `word_length`.
4. `average_per_word` uses the previously assigned variables to calculate the average number of letters per word.

Without the walrus operator, you would need to declare these variables outside the dictionary, making the code longer and less readable.

---

### Example 2: Using the Walrus Operator in a While Loop

Another great use case for the walrus operator is in `while` loops. Here’s an example of a simple chat prompt:

```python
while (user_input := input("You: ")):
    print(f"You said: {user_input}")
    if user_input.lower() == "quit":
        break
```

In this code:

- `(user_input := input("You: "))` assigns the user’s input to the variable `user_input` and evaluates the truthiness of the input.
- If the input is an empty string (`""`), the loop stops because empty strings are falsy in Python.
- If the input is `"quit"`, the loop breaks explicitly.

This approach keeps the code concise and readable, avoiding the need for separate assignment and evaluation lines.

---

### Example 3: Using the Walrus Operator for List Comprehensions

The walrus operator can also be used in list comprehensions to simplify complex operations. For instance:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [n ** 2 for n in numbers if (is_even := n % 2 == 0)]
print(squares)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

In this example, `is_even := n % 2 == 0` assigns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is even. The list comprehension then includes only the squares of even numbers.

---

### Example 4: Using the Walrus Operator for Data Processing

When processing data, the walrus operator can help you avoid redundant calculations. For example:

```python
data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]

for item in data:
    if (age := item["age"]) > 30:
        print(f"{item['name']} is older than 30.")
    else:
        print(f"{item['name']} is 30 or younger.")
```

Here, `age := item["age"]` assigns the age of each person to the variable `age` and checks if it’s greater than 30. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

---

### Example 5: Using the Walrus Operator for File Handling

The walrus operator can also be useful when working with files. For instance:

```python
if (file := open("example.txt", "r")):
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    file.close()
```

This code opens a file, assigns it to the variable `file`, and checks if the file was opened successfully. If it was, the code reads the content, prints it, and closes the file.

---

### Example 6: Using the Walrus Operator for Regular Expressions

When working with regular expressions, the walrus operator can simplify your code. For example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"

if (match := re.search(pattern, "The number is 42")):
    print(f"Found a match: {match.group()}")
else:
    print("No match found.")
```

In this example, `match := re.search(pattern, "The number is 42")` assigns the result of the search to the variable `match` and checks if a match was found.

---

### Example 7: Using the Walrus Operator for Dictionary Operations

The walrus operator can also be used with dictionaries to simplify operations. For example:

```python
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

if (name := data.get("name")):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
else:
    print("Name not found.")
```

In this example, `name := data.get("name")` assigns the value of the `"name"` key to the variable `name` and checks if it exists.

---

### Example 8: Using the Walrus Operator for Mathematical Calculations

The walrus operator can be useful in mathematical calculations to avoid redundant computations. For example:

```python
def calculate_stats(numbers):
    sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
    average = sum_numbers / len(numbers)
    return {
        "sum": sum_numbers,
        "average": average,
        "count": len(numbers)
    }

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
stats = calculate_stats(numbers)
print(f"Sum: {stats['sum']}, Average: {stats['average']}, Count: {stats['count']}")
```

In this example, the walrus operator can be used to simplify the function by assigning values to variables within the return statement.

---

### Example 9: Using the Walrus Operator for Data Validation

The walrus operator can be used to validate data before processing it. For example:

```python
def validate_data(data):
    if (is_valid := isinstance(data, dict)):
        print("Data is valid.")
        return data
    else:
        print("Data is invalid.")
        return None

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
validated_data = validate_data(data)
print(validated_data)
```

In this example, `is_valid := isinstance(data, dict)` assigns a boolean value indicating whether the data is a dictionary and checks if it’s valid.

---

### Example 10: Using the Walrus Operator for Error Handling

The walrus operator can be used in error handling to simplify exception management. For example:

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        if (result := a / b):
            print(f"The result is {result}.")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

divide_numbers(10, 2)
divide_numbers(10, 0)
```

In this example, `result := a / b` assigns the result of the division to the variable `result` and checks if it’s truthy.

---

### Example 11: Using the Walrus Operator for Logging

The walrus operator can be used for logging purposes to simplify the code. For example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_operation(operation, result):
    if (logged := logging.info(f"Operation: {operation}, Result: {result}")):
        print("Logged successfully.")

log_operation("Addition", 10 + 5)
```

In this example, `logged := logging.info(...)` assigns the result of the logging operation to the variable `logged` and checks if it was successful.

---

### Example 12: Using the Walrus Operator for Debugging

The walrus operator can be a valuable tool for debugging purposes. For example:

```python
def debug_variable(var):
    if (value := var):
        print(f"Variable value: {value}")
    else:
        print("Variable is empty or None.")

debug_variable("Hello, World!")
debug_variable(None)
```

In this example, `value := var` assigns the value of the variable to `value` and checks if it’s truthy.

---

### Example 13: Using the Walrus Operator for Data Transformation

The walrus operator can be used to transform data in a concise way. For example:

```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_data = [n ** 2 for n in data if (is_even := n % 2 == 0)]
print(squared_data)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

In this example, `is_even := n % 2 == 0` assigns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is even and checks if it’s true.

---

### Example 14: Using the Walrus Operator for Performance Optimization

The walrus operator can be used to optimize performance by avoiding redundant calculations. For example:

```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    if (area := width * height):
        print(f"Area: {area}")
    else:
        print("Invalid dimensions.")

calculate_area(5, 10)
calculate_area(0, 10)
```

In this example, `area := width * height` assigns the result of the multiplication to `area` and checks if it’s truthy.

---

### Example 15: Using the Walrus Operator for API Requests

The walrus operator can be used to handle API requests more efficiently. For example:

```python
import requests

def fetch_data(url):
    if (response := requests.get(url)):
        print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
        print(f"Content: {response.text}")
    else:
        print("Request failed.")

fetch_data("https://example.com")
```

In this example, `response := requests.get(url)` assigns the response object to `response` and checks if the request was successful.

---

### Example 16: Using the Walrus Operator for Data Serialization

The walrus operator can be used for data serialization tasks. For example:

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

if (serialized_data := json.dumps(data)):
    print(f"Serialized data: {serialized_data}")
else:
    print("Serialization failed.")
```

In this example, `serialized_data := json.dumps(data)` assigns the serialized data to `serialized_data` and checks if it’s truthy.

---

### Example 17: Using the Walrus Operator for File Operations

The walrus operator can be used to simplify file operations. For example:

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as (file := open("example.txt", "r")):
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this example, `file := open("example.txt", "r")` assigns the file object to `file` and checks if it was opened successfully.

---

### Example 18: Using the Walrus Operator for Database Queries

The walrus operator can be used to handle database queries more efficiently. For example:

```python
import sqlite3

def execute_query(query):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    if (result := cursor.execute(query)):
        print(f"Query result: {result.fetchall()}")
    else:
        print("Query execution failed.")
    conn.close()

execute_query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

In this example, `result := cursor.execute(query)` assigns the result of the query execution to `result` and checks if it was successful.

---

### Example 19: Using the Walrus Operator for Network Operations

The walrus operator can be used to simplify network operations. For example:

```python
import socket

def get_ip(hostname):
    if (ip := socket.gethostbyname(hostname)):
        print(f"IP address of {hostname}: {ip}")
    else:
        print(f"Unable to resolve {hostname}.")

get_ip("example.com")
```

In this example, `ip := socket.gethostbyname(hostname)` assigns the IP address to `ip` and checks if it was resolved successfully.

---

### Example 20: Using the Walrus Operator for Cryptographic Operations

The walrus operator can be used to simplify cryptographic operations. For example:

```python
import hashlib

def hash_data(data):
    if (hashed := hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()):
        print(f"SHA-256 hash: {hashed}")
    else:
        print("Hashing failed.")

hash_data("Hello, World!")
```

In this example, `hashed := hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()` assigns the hashed value to `hashed` and checks if it was generated successfully.

---

### Example 21: Using the Walrus Operator for GUI Applications

The walrus operator can be used in GUI applications to simplify event handling. For example:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def on_click():
    if (button := tk.Button(root, text="Click me!")):
        button.pack()
        button.config(command=lambda: print("Button clicked!"))

root = tk.Tk()
on_click()
root.mainloop()
```

In this example, `button := tk.Button(...)` assigns the button widget to `button` and checks if it was created successfully.

---

### Example 22: Using the Walrus Operator for Web Development

The walrus operator can be used in web development to simplify tasks. For example:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

def route_handler():
    if (route := app.route("/")):
        route(lambda: "Hello, World!")
    else:
        print("Route registration failed.")

route_handler()
```

In this example, `route := app.route(...)` assigns the route object to `route` and checks if it was registered successfully.

---

### Example 23: Using the Walrus Operator for Testing

The walrus operator can be used in testing to simplify assertions. For example:

```python
import unittest

class TestWalrusOperator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_assignment(self):
        self.assertTrue((value := 10) > 5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, `value := 10` assigns the value 10 to `value` and checks if it’s greater than 5.

---

### Example 24: Using the Walrus Operator for Logging and Monitoring

The walrus operator can be used for logging and monitoring purposes. For example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_operation(operation, result):
    if (logged := logging.info(f"Operation: {operation}, Result: {result}")):
        print("Logged successfully.")

log_operation("Addition", 10 + 5)
```

In this example, `logged := logging.info(...)` assigns the result of the logging operation to `logged` and checks if it was successful.

---

### Example 25: Using the Walrus Operator for Debugging and Profiling

The walrus operator can be used for debugging and profiling code. For example:

```python
import time

def debug_variable(var):
    if (value := var):
        print(f"Variable value: {value}")
    else:
        print("Variable is empty or None.")

start_time = time.time()
debug_variable("Hello, World!")
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

In this example, `value := var` assigns the value of the variable to `value` and checks if it’s truthy.

---

### Example 26: Using the Walrus Operator for Data Analysis

The walrus operator can be used in data analysis to simplify operations. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "Age": [30, 25, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

if (average_age := df["Age"].mean()):
    print(f"Average age: {average_age}")
else:
    print("Unable to calculate average age.")
```

In this example, `average_age := df["Age"].mean()` assigns the average age to `average_age` and checks if it’s truthy.

---

### Example 27: Using the Walrus Operator for Machine Learning

The walrus operator can be used in machine learning to simplify model training. For example:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

if (model := LinearRegression().fit(X, y)):
    print("Model trained successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to train the model.")
```

# 004 Dataclasses



## Simplifying Data Modeling in Python with Data Classes

When working with data in Python, creating models can be straightforward, but using traditional classes often leads to unnecessary boilerplate code. In this section, we’ll explore how Python’s `dataclasses` module can simplify your workflow and make your code cleaner and more efficient.

### The Problem with Regular Classes

Let’s start by looking at how we might create a simple data model using a traditional class. Suppose we want to model a `Fruit` class:

```python
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name: str, calories: float):
        self.name = name
        self.calories = calories

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
```

While this works, it requires writing an `__init__` method, initializing each attribute, and defining an `__eq__` method for equality checks. This is a lot of code for a simple data model, especially when all we need is a class to hold data.

### Introducing Python Data Classes

Enter **data classes**, a feature introduced in Python 3.7. Data classes are designed to simplify the creation of classes that mainly hold data. They automatically handle boilerplate code such as `__init__`, `__eq__`, and other special methods.

Here’s how we can redefine the `Fruit` class using a data class:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Fruit:
    name: str
    calories: float
```

That’s it! The `@dataclass` decorator takes care of generating the `__init__` method, `__eq__`, and other special methods for us.

### Key Benefits of Data Classes

1. **Less Boilerplate Code**:
   Data classes reduce the amount of code you need to write. Instead of manually writing `__init__` and `__eq__`, you can focus on defining your data model.

2. **Built-in Equality Checks**:
   Data classes automatically implement the `__eq__` method, which checks if two instances are equal based on their attributes.

3. **Better String Representation**:
   Data classes provide a human-readable string representation of instances by default. For example:
   ```python
   apple = Fruit("Apple", 10)
   print(apple)  # Output: Fruit(name='Apple', calories=10)
   ```

4. **Type Hints**:
   Data classes support type hints, making your code more readable and maintainable.

### Example Usage

Let’s create a few instances of our `Fruit` data class and compare them:

```python
apple = Fruit("Apple", 10)
apple2 = Fruit("Apple", 10)
orange = Fruit("Orange", 15)

print(apple == apple2)  # Output: True
print(apple == orange)  # Output: False
```

As you can see, comparing instances works seamlessly thanks to the built-in `__eq__` method.

### Customizing Data Classes

While data classes provide default implementations for special methods, you can override them if needed. For example, you can define a custom `__repr__` method or add additional functionality:

```python
@dataclass
class Fruit:
    name: str
    calories: float

    def get_caloric_info(self):
        if self.calories < 20:
            return f"{self.name} is a low-calorie fruit."
        else:
            return f"{self.name} is a high-calorie fruit."
```

### Tips and Tricks

- **Use Default Values**: You can assign default values to attributes in your data class:
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class Fruit:
      name: str
      calories: float = 0
  ```

- **Immutability**: To create immutable data classes, use the `frozen=True` parameter in the `@dataclass` decorator:
  ```python
  @dataclass(frozen=True)
  class Fruit:
      name: str
      calories: float
  ```

- **Inheritance**: Data classes can inherit from other classes, including other data classes. This is useful for creating hierarchical data models.

- **Third-Party Libraries**: If you’re using Python versions older than 3.7, consider using third-party libraries like `attr` or `pydantic` for similar functionality.

- **When Not to Use Data Classes**: Avoid using data classes when you need complex logic or inheritance structures. Stick to regular classes for such cases.

- **Documentation**: Always use type hints and docstrings to make your data classes more understandable to others (and yourself in the future).

By switching to data classes, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code and focus on the logic that matters. Whether you’re working on a small script or a large application, data classes can significantly improve your development workflow.

So the next time you need to create a data model, give data classes a try—you’ll wonder how you ever managed without them!

# 005 Generators



## Using Generators in Python for Memory Efficiency

### Introduction

When working with large datasets in Python, creating a list with millions of elements can consume a significant amount of memory, slowing down your program. This is where **generators** come into play. Generators allow you to load data one element at a time, making them a memory-efficient solution for handling large datasets.

### What Are Generators?

Generators are functions that use the `yield` keyword to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example. This approach is known as **lazy evaluation**, where values are generated only when needed.

### Creating a Generator

Here’s an example of a simple generator function:

```python
def generate_list(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i
```

- The `yield` keyword is what makes this function a generator.
- When you call `generate_list(10**100)`, it doesn’t immediately create a list of 10^100 elements. Instead, it creates a generator object.

### Using the Generator

To use the generator, you can call it and iterate over it:

```python
generator = generate_list(10**100)
print(next(generator))  # Prints 0
print(next(generator))  # Prints 1
```

Each call to `next()` returns the next value from the generator. This is memory efficient because only one value is loaded into memory at a time.

### Controlling the Number of Elements

If you want to limit the number of elements you process, you can use a loop with a condition to break out early:

```python
list_a = []
for number in generator:
    list_a.append(number)
    if number == 1000:
        break
print(len(list_a))  # Prints 1001
```

### Understanding Exhaustive Generators

Generators are **exhaustive**, meaning once you’ve iterated through them, the values are no longer available. For example:

```python
list_b = []
for number in generator:
    if number == 10:
        break
    list_b.append(number)

print(next(generator))  # Prints 11
```

After the first loop, the generator starts from where it left off.

### Generator Comprehensions

You can also create generators using comprehensions, similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of square brackets:

```python
gen_comp = (i for i in range(10**100))
print(next(gen_comp))  # Prints 0
```

### Key Benefits of Generators

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Generators use significantly less memory because they don’t store the entire dataset at once.
2. **Flexibility**: You can control how much data you process at a time.
3. **Performance**: Generators are faster for large datasets because they avoid the overhead of creating and storing large lists.

### Tips and Tricks

- **Lazy Loading**: Generators are perfect for lazy loading data, especially when working with large datasets.
- **Avoid Converting Generators to Lists**: If you convert a generator to a list, you lose the memory efficiency benefits.
- **Use Cases**: Generators are ideal for reading large files, handling infinite sequences, or processing data in chunks.
- **Infinite Generators**: Be cautious with infinite generators. Always include a condition to break out of the loop when necessary.
- **Debugging**: Use `next()` to manually iterate through a generator during debugging to understand its behavior.

By using generators, you can write more efficient and scalable Python code, especially when dealing with large datasets.

# 006 Delete



## Using the `del` Keyword in Python to Delete Objects and Variables

Python provides the `del` keyword as a powerful tool to remove objects, variables, or items from lists and dictionaries. This can be useful for freeing up memory, reusing variable names, or simply cleaning up your namespace. In this section, we'll explore how to use the `del` keyword effectively with examples.

---

### Deleting Items from a List

Let's start with a simple example of deleting an item from a list. Suppose we have a list of people and we want to remove one of them:

```python
people = ["Mario", "Toad"]
del people[1]
print(people)  # Output: ["Mario"]
```

In this example, we use `del people[1]` to remove the item at index `1` (which is "Toad") from the list. After deletion, the list contains only "Mario".

---

### Deleting Key-Value Pairs from a Dictionary

The `del` keyword can also be used to remove specific key-value pairs from a dictionary:

```python
data = {"field1": 100, "field2": "200"}
del data["field2"]
print(data)  # Output: {"field1": 100}
```

Here, `del data["field2"]` removes the key-value pair with the key `"field2"` from the dictionary.

---

### Deleting Variables

You can even use `del` to delete variables entirely. Once a variable is deleted, it no longer exists in the namespace:

```python
name = "Mario"
del name
print(name)  # This will raise a NameError: name is not defined
```

After deleting `name`, attempting to access it will result in a `NameError`.

---

### Deleting Class Instances

The `del` keyword is also useful when working with classes. Let's create a simple data class and demonstrate how to delete an instance:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Fruit:
    name: str
    calories: float

apple = Fruit("Apple", 40)
del apple
print(apple)  # This will raise a NameError: name 'apple' is not defined
```

After deleting the `apple` instance, any attempt to reference it will result in a `NameError`.

---

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Use `del` Sparingly**: While `del` is a useful tool, it's often not necessary to use it unless you specifically need to free up memory or reuse variable names.

2. **Be Careful with References**: If you delete an object that other variables reference, those references will still exist but will point to a deleted object. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Avoid Using `del` in Global Scope**: Deleting variables in the global scope can lead to confusing bugs, especially in larger programs. Use `del` primarily in functions or loops where the scope is limited.

4. **Garbage Collection**: Python has automatic garbage collection, so in most cases, you don't need to use `del` unless you're working with very large objects or limited memory environments.

5. **Advanced Use Cases**: For more advanced use cases, consider using `weakref` module for weak references or `gc` module for manual garbage collection.

---

### Conclusion

The `del` keyword is a handy tool for removing objects, variables, or items from data structures in Python. Whether you're cleaning up your namespace, freeing up memory, or managing class instances, `del` can be a powerful ally in your Python programming journey. Just remember to use it wisely and with caution to avoid unexpected side effects.

# 007 Assert



## Error Handling in Python: Using the Assert Keyword for Robust Code

### Introduction to Error Handling

In software development, handling errors and exceptions is crucial to ensure your application runs smoothly. If your program crashes due to unexpected errors, users may lose trust and stop using your app. This guide introduces Python's `assert` keyword, a powerful tool to catch errors early in the development phase, ensuring your code is robust before deployment.

### Introducing the Assert Keyword

The `assert` keyword is used to let the program test if a condition in your code returns True. If it does, the program proceeds; if not, the program raises an `AssertionError`, stopping execution. This is particularly useful for catching logical errors that could cause your program to fail.

#### Example Usage of Assert

Consider a function that requires a dictionary input:

```python
def start_program(data):
    assert isinstance(data, dict), "Invalid JSON data"
    assert data, "No data found"
    print("Program loaded successfully.")

# Example usage:
json_data = {"name": "Mario"}
start_program(json_data)  # Program loads successfully

empty_data = {}
start_program(empty_data)  # Raises AssertionError: No data found

wrong_type = ["list", "instead", "of", "dict"]
start_program(wrong_type)  # Raises AssertionError: Invalid JSON data
```

In this example, `assert` checks if the input is a dictionary and not empty, raising specific errors if either condition fails.

### Assert vs If-Else Statements

While both `assert` and `if-else` can check conditions, they serve different purposes:

- **Assert**: Used for debugging to catch conditions that should never occur. It helps developers identify logical errors early.
- **If-Else**: Used for handling expected conditions, such as user input validation, where certain conditions are anticipated and handled gracefully.

### Optimizing for Production

When moving your code to production, it's wise to remove assertions to optimize performance. Assertions add overhead and are typically not needed once the code is thoroughly tested.

#### Disabling Assertions

Use the `-O` flag when running your Python script to disable assertions:

```bash
python -O your_script.py
```

This compiles the script without the `__debug__` flag, effectively ignoring all `assert` statements.

#### Example of Optimization

```python
def start_program(data):
    assert isinstance(data, dict), "Invalid JSON data"
    print("Program loaded successfully.")

# With debug mode off, assertions are skipped
if __debug__:
    print("Debug mode is active")
else:
    print("Debug mode is inactive")
```

Running with `-O` will output:

```
Program loaded successfully.
Debug mode is inactive
```

### Disabling Docstrings

Docstrings, while helpful for documentation, can increase the script's size. Use the `-OO` flag to remove them:

```bash
python -OO your_script.py
```

### Tips and Tricks

- **Use Assert Wisely**: Reserve `assert` for critical conditions that indicate a bug, not for user errors.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all possible issues are covered in your test cases.
- **Optimize for Production**: Always remove assertions and docstrings when deploying to ensure optimal performance.
- **Understand the Trade-offs**: While optimizations improve performance, they may complicate debugging, so use them judiciously.

By incorporating `assert` into your debugging routine and optimizing your code for production, you can write more robust and efficient Python programs. Remember, `assert` is a developer's best friend for catching issues early, ensuring your code is reliable and production-ready.

# 008 Match-Case



## Introduction to Python's Match-Case Statement

Python 3.10 introduced a powerful new feature: the `match-case` statement, which is similar to the `switch` statement found in other programming languages. This feature allows for cleaner and more expressive code when handling multiple conditional checks. In this section, we'll explore how to use the `match-case` statement, its benefits, and provide examples to help you get started.

### Basic Syntax and Example

Let's start with a basic example to understand the syntax. Suppose we have an HTTP status code and want to determine the corresponding message:

```python
status = 400

match status:
    case 400:
        print("Bad request...")
    case 403:
        print("Forbidden...")
    case 404:
        print("Not found...")
    case _:
        print("Something went wrong...")
```

- **`match`**: This keyword is used to start the `match-case` block.
- **`case`**: Each `case` specifies a condition to check against the value following `match`.
- **`_`**: This is a wildcard that matches any value not explicitly covered by the previous cases.

### Example: HTTP Status Codes

Let's use the `match-case` statement to handle HTTP status codes:

```python
status = 400

match status:
    case 400:
        print("Bad request...")
    case 403:
        print("Forbidden...")
    case 404:
        print("Not found...")
    case _:
        print("Something went wrong...")
```

- **400**: Indicates a bad request.
- **403**: Indicates a forbidden request.
- **404**: Indicates that the page was not found.
- **_**: Handles any other status code by printing a generic message.

### Example: User Input Handling

Let's take a more complex example where we process user input:

```python
user_input = input("Enter a command: ")
processed_command = user_input.split()

match processed_command:
    case ["find", *images]:
        print(f"Finding images: {images}")
    case ["download", *images]:
        print(f"Downloading images: {images}")
    case ["delete" | "cancel", *images]:
        print(f"Deleting images: {images}")
    case _:
        print("Command not recognized.")
```

- **Pattern Matching**: The `*images` syntax allows us to capture multiple values into a list.
- **Or Conditions**: Using `|` allows us to match multiple patterns in a single case.
- **Wildcard `_`**: Handles any unrecognized commands.

### Advanced Features: Adding Conditions to Cases

You can also add conditions to cases using the `if` keyword:

```python
match processed_command:
    case ["delete", *images] if len(images) > 1:
        print(f"Deleting images: {images}")
    case _:
        print("Command not recognized or invalid arguments.")
```

This ensures that the case is only triggered if the condition is met.

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with simple `match-case` statements to get familiar with the syntax.
2. **Use Wildcards**: The `_` wildcard is useful for handling unexpected values.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Take advantage of pattern matching to simplify complex conditional logic.
4. **Read the Documentation**: Python's `match-case` statement is powerful and has many features. Make sure to read the official documentation to explore all its capabilities.
5. **Practice**: The best way to learn is by doing. Try converting your existing `if-else` chains into `match-case` statements.

### Conclusion

The `match-case` statement in Python is a powerful tool that can make your code cleaner and more readable. By leveraging pattern matching and advanced features like conditions within cases, you can handle complex logic with ease. Start experimenting with this feature today and see how it can improve your code!

# 009 Decorators



## Creating Custom Decorators in Python to Enhance Code Readability

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of a function without permanently changing it. In this section, we will explore how to create a custom decorator to time the execution of a function, improving code readability and functionality.

### Introduction to Decorators

Decorators are a special kind of syntax in Python that allows you to wrap another function to extend its behavior. They are often used for logging, authentication, timing functions, and more. You may have seen decorators like `@dataclass` or `@property` in your code, which simplify class definitions and property access, respectively.

### Why Use Decorators?

Decorators provide a clean and reusable way to add functionality to existing code. Instead of rewriting or duplicating code, you can create a decorator to encapsulate the additional behavior and apply it wherever needed.

### Timing Functions with a Custom Decorator

Let’s create a custom decorator to time how long a function takes to execute. This can be useful for optimizing performance-critical code.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Modules

First, we need to import the necessary modules:

```python
from functools import wraps
from time import perf_counter, sleep
```

- `functools.wraps`: This is used to preserve the original function’s metadata (like its name and docstring) when it is wrapped by a decorator.
- `time.perf_counter()`: Provides a high-resolution timer for measuring small time intervals.
- `time.sleep()`: Used to simulate a delay in our example function.

#### Step 2: Create the Function to be Decorated

Let’s define a simple function that we want to time:

```python
def do_something(param):
    """Do something important."""
    sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay
    print(param)
```

This function takes a parameter, sleeps for 1 second, and then prints the parameter. The delay is added to make the timing more noticeable.

#### Step 3: Create the Custom Decorator

Now, let’s create our custom decorator called `timing_decorator`:

```python
def timing_decorator(func):
    """Times any function."""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = perf_counter()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time: float = perf_counter()
        total_time: float = round(end_time - start_time, 3)
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' took {total_time} seconds to execute.")

    return wrapper
```

- The `timing_decorator` function takes another function `func` as its argument.
- The `@wraps(func)` decorator is applied to the `wrapper` function to preserve the original function’s metadata.
- The `wrapper` function calculates the start and end times, calls the original function, and prints the total execution time.
- The `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax allows the decorator to handle any positional and keyword arguments passed to the function.

#### Step 4: Apply the Decorator

Now, let’s apply our decorator to the `do_something` function:

```python
@timing_decorator
def do_something(param):
    """Do something important."""
    sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay
    print(param)
```

With this decorator in place, every time `do_something` is called, it will print the execution time.

#### Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the decorated function:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    do_something("Hello")
```

When you run this code, you should see output like this:

```
Hello
Function 'do_something' took 1.001 seconds to execute.
```

### Why Use `functools.wraps`?

The `@wraps(func)` decorator is crucial because it ensures that the metadata (like the function name and docstring) of the original function is preserved. Without it, the decorated function would appear as the `wrapper` function in tools like debuggers and IDEs.

For example, without `@wraps(func)`, the following code:

```python
print(do_something.__name__)
print(do_something.__doc__)
```

Would output:

```
wrapper
None
```

But with `@wraps(func)`, it outputs:

```
do_something
Do something important.
```

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Use Decorators for Logging**: Decorators can be used to log function inputs, outputs, and execution times for debugging purposes.
2. **Preserve Metadata**: Always use `@wraps(func)` to preserve the original function’s metadata.
3. **Handle Arguments Flexibly**: Use `*args` and `**kwargs` to ensure your decorator works with any function, regardless of its arguments.
4. **Test Your Decorators**: Decorators can sometimes introduce unexpected behavior, so always test them thoroughly.
5. **Keep Decorators Simple**: Avoid adding complex logic directly in the decorator. Instead, break it down into helper functions for better readability.

By following these steps and tips, you can create powerful and reusable decorators to enhance your Python code. Decorators are a key feature of Python that can make your code cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient.

# 010 Decorators (Continued)



## Adding Parameters to Python Decorators: A Comprehensive Guide

Decorators in Python are powerful tools that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of a function without permanently changing it. While we’ve covered the basics of decorators in previous tutorials, there’s still more to explore—especially when it comes to adding parameters to decorators. In this section, we’ll dive into how you can create more customized decorators by adding parameters, making your decorators more flexible and reusable.

### Why Add Parameters to Decorators?

Decorators are cool, but sometimes you need more control over their behavior. For instance, you might want a decorator that can repeat a function a certain number of times or add a custom message before executing the function. This is where parameters come into play. By allowing your decorators to accept parameters, you can create more dynamic and customizable behaviors.

### Example: Creating a Repeat Decorator with Parameters

Let’s create a decorator called `repeat` that can execute a function multiple times. We’ll also add a parameter to specify how many times the function should be repeated.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Decorator

```python
from functools import wraps
from typing import Callable

def repeat(times: int) -> Callable:
    """Repeat function call a specified number of times."""
    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            value = None
            for _ in range(times):
                value = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return value
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

#### Step 2: Breaking Down the Code

- **Importing Necessary Modules**: We import `wraps` from `functools` to preserve the original function’s metadata and `Callable` from `typing` for type hinting.
- **Outer Function (`repeat`)**: This function takes an integer `times` as a parameter and returns the actual decorator.
- **Inner Function (`decorator`)**: This function takes the target function `func` as an argument and returns the `wrapper` function.
- **Wrapper Function**: This is where the magic happens. It takes the arguments and keyword arguments of the target function, executes it `times` number of times, and returns the result.

#### Step 3: Using the Decorator

Now that we’ve created the `repeat` decorator, let’s see how to use it.

```python
@repeat(2)
def function_one():
    print("Hello!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    function_one()
```

When you run this code, you’ll see "Hello!" printed twice because the decorator is set to repeat the function two times.

### Customizing Further: Adding More Parameters

You can take your decorator to the next level by adding more parameters. Let’s say you want to add a message that gets printed before each function call.

#### Updated Decorator with a Message

```python
from functools import wraps
from typing import Callable

def repeat(times: int, message: str = "") -> Callable:
    """Repeat function call a specified number of times with a custom message."""
    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(times):
                print(message)
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

#### Using the Updated Decorator

```python
@repeat(2, "Hello!")
def function_one():
    print("World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    function_one()
```

This will output:

```
Hello!
World!
Hello!
World!
```

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Use `functools.wraps`**: This ensures that the decorated function retains its original metadata, making debugging easier.
2. **Type Hinting**: Use type hints to make your code more readable and maintainable.
3. **Handle Keyword Arguments**: Make sure your decorator works with functions that accept both positional and keyword arguments.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your decorator with different functions and edge cases to ensure it works as expected.
5. **Add Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to manage cases where invalid parameters are passed to the decorator.

### Conclusion

Adding parameters to decorators is a simple yet powerful way to make your decorators more flexible and reusable. By wrapping your decorator with an outer function that accepts parameters, you can create highly customizable behaviors. Remember to use `functools.wraps` for preserving function metadata and test your decorators thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. Happy coding!

# 011 Memoization



## Optimizing Recursive Functions with Memoization in Python

Recursive functions can be elegant solutions for problems like calculating Fibonacci numbers, but they can become inefficient due to repeated computations. Memoization is a technique that optimizes such functions by caching results, thereby improving performance. Let's explore how memoization works and how to implement it in Python.

### The Problem with Recursive Functions

Recursive functions can lead to exponential time complexity due to redundant calculations. For example, calculating Fibonacci numbers recursively results in many repeated calls, each recomputing the same values.

### What is Memoization?

Memoization is a technique where results of expensive function calls are cached. Once a function computes a result for specific inputs, the result is stored. Subsequent calls with the same inputs retrieve the result from the cache, avoiding redundant computations.

### Example Without Memoization

Consider a recursive Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This function recalculates many values, leading to slow performance for large `n`.

### Implementing a Custom Memoize Decorator

We can create a decorator to cache function results:

```python
def memoize(func):
    cache: dict = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key: str = str(args) + str(kwargs)
        if key not in cache:
            cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return cache[key]
    
    return wrapper
```

Using this decorator with our Fibonacci function:

```python
@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

### Trade-offs of Memoization

- **Speed Improvement:** Avoids redundant calculations, significantly speeding up recursive functions.
- **Memory Cost:** The cache consumes memory, which can be a concern for large datasets.

### Using Built-in Memoization

Python's `functools` module provides `cache` for memoization:

```python
from functools import cache

@cache
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

### Increasing Recursion Limit

For deep recursion, adjust Python's recursion limit:

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10_000)
```

### Tips and Tricks

- **Use Built-ins:** Prefer `functools.cache` for simplicity and efficiency.
- **Memory Management:** Consider cache size to balance speed and memory usage.
- **Recursion Limits:** Adjust if encountering recursion depth errors.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for functions with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

Memoization is a powerful optimization technique, especially for recursive functions. By caching results, it reduces redundant computations, enhancing performance.

# 012 Context Managers



## Understanding Context Managers in Python: A Step-by-Step Guide

Context managers in Python are a powerful tool for managing resources such as files, connections, and locks. They ensure that resources are properly set up and cleaned up, even when exceptions occur. In this guide, we will explore how to create and use custom context managers.

### What are Context Managers?

A context manager is an object that defines the runtime context to be established when the execution enters a `with` statement. It is responsible for setting up and tearing down the runtime context. The most common use case is file handling, where the context manager opens the file upon entering the `with` block and closes it upon exiting.

### Using Built-in Context Managers

Before diving into creating custom context managers, let's review how built-in context managers work. Consider the following example:

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

Here, `open` returns a context manager that opens the file when entering the `with` block and closes it when exiting. This ensures that the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs.

### Creating a Custom Context Manager

To create a custom context manager, you need to define a class that implements the context manager protocol. This involves defining two special methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

#### Step 1: Define the Class and Constructor

Start by defining a class and its constructor. The constructor should take any necessary parameters, such as the name of the file.

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

#### Step 2: Implement the `__enter__` Method

The `__enter__` method is called when the `with` statement is executed. It sets up the runtime context and returns an object that can be used within the `with` block.

```python
def __enter__(self):
    self.file = open(self.name, 'r')
    return self.file
```

In this example, the `__enter__` method opens the file and returns the file object, allowing you to read from the file within the `with` block.

#### Step 3: Implement the `__exit__` Method

The `__exit__` method is called when the `with` block is exited. It is responsible for cleaning up the runtime context. It takes three optional parameters: `exc_type`, `exc_val`, and `exc_tb`, which provide information about any exception that occurred within the `with` block.

```python
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    if self.file:
        self.file.close()
    print(f"Closed {self.name}")
```

In this example, the `__exit__` method closes the file and prints a message indicating that the file has been closed.

### Using the Custom Context Manager

Now that you have defined the `FileManager` class, you can use it as a context manager:

```python
with FileManager('file.txt') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```

When you run this code, the `FileManager` class will open the file, allow you to read its content, and then close the file automatically, even if an exception occurs.

### Tips and Tricks

- **Handling Exceptions**: The `__exit__` method can handle exceptions by checking the `exc_type`, `exc_val`, and `exc_tb` parameters. If any of these parameters are not `None`, it means an exception occurred within the `with` block.

- **Returning Values from `__enter__`**: The `__enter__` method can return any object that provides the necessary functionality for the `with` block. In the example above, it returns the file object, allowing you to read from the file.

- **Using `contextlib.contextmanager`**: Python's `contextlib` module provides a decorator called `contextmanager` that can simplify the creation of context managers by allowing you to define them using generator functions instead of classes.

- **Best Practices**: Always ensure that resources are properly cleaned up in the `__exit__` method. This includes closing files, releasing locks, and rolling back transactions.

- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your custom context managers to ensure they handle both normal execution and exceptions correctly.

By following this guide, you can create custom context managers that effectively manage resources and ensure proper cleanup. This will make your code more robust and easier to maintain.

## 013 Timing Code Performance



## Timing Functions in Python: A Comprehensive Guide

Timing functions is an essential skill for any developer looking to optimize their code's performance. Whether you're comparing different implementations or identifying bottlenecks, understanding how long your functions take to execute can significantly improve your code's efficiency. In this section, we'll explore two effective ways to time your functions in Python: using the `time` module and the `timeit` module.

---

### Why Time Functions?

Before diving into the methods, let's quickly explore why timing functions is important:

1. **Performance Comparison**: Timing allows you to compare different implementations of the same function to determine which one is faster.
2. **Optimization**: By identifying slow parts of your code, you can focus your optimization efforts where they matter most.
3. **Benchmarking**: Timing functions helps you establish a baseline performance metric for your code, which can be used to measure improvements over time.

---

### Method 1: Using the `time` Module

The `time` module provides a straightforward way to measure the execution time of your code. Here's how you can use it:

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Import the `time` Module**:
   ```python
   import time
   ```

2. **Record the Start Time**:
   ```python
   start_time: float = time.perf_counter()
   ```

3. **Insert Your Code or Function**:
   ```python
   for i in range(10**9):
       pass
   print("Hello")
   time.sleep(1)
   ```

4. **Record the End Time**:
   ```python
   end_time: float = time.perf_counter()
   ```

5. **Calculate the Total Time**:
   ```python
   total_time: float = end_time - start_time
   print(f"Total time: {total_time} seconds")
   ```

#### Example in Action

When you run this code, it will output the total time taken to execute the loop and the sleep statement. For example:
```
Total time: 18.4321 seconds
```

#### Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**: Simple and easy to use for quick tests.
- **Limitations**: Results can vary depending on system load, and it only runs the test once, which may not give accurate results for small functions.

---

### Method 2: Using the `timeit` Module

For more accurate and robust timing, the `timeit` module is the preferred choice. It allows you to run multiple tests and provides more reliable results.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Import the `timeit` Module**:
   ```python
   import timeit
   ```

2. **Define Functions to Test**:
   ```python
   def make_calculation(a, b):
       for _ in range(10**6):
           pass
       return a + b

   def do_something():
       for i in range(10):
           x = i ** i
   ```

3. **Create a Timing Function**:
   ```python
   def get_time(func, repeat=5, number=10**6):
       speed = timeit.repeat(
           stmt=func,
           repeat=repeat,
           number=number,
           globals=globals()
       )
       min_speed = min(speed)
       print(f"{func} took: {min_speed:.4f} seconds")
       print(f"Ran {repeat * number:,} times")
       return min_speed
   ```

4. **Test Your Functions**:
   ```python
    if __name__=='__main__':
        # Test do_something()
        get_time("do_something()", repeat=10, number=10**5)

        # Test make_calculation with arguments
        a, b = 1, 2
        get_time("make_calculation(a, b)", repeat=5, number=10**5)
   ```

#### Example Output

When you run this code, you'll see results like this:
```

# 014 Optimizing Code



## The Dangers of Premature Optimization in Python: A Developer's Guide

When it comes to writing efficient code, timing functions, and optimizing performance, it's easy to get carried away. You might find yourself striving to save a second, half a second, or even a few nanoseconds. However, it's crucial to avoid falling into the trap of premature optimization—a practice often referred to as "the root of all evil" in software development. Let’s dive into why premature optimization can be harmful and how to approach it wisely.

---

### What is Premature Optimization?

Premature optimization is the practice of optimizing code before it is necessary or before the code is even fully functional. While the intention to make code faster and more efficient is good, optimizing too early can lead to wasted time and effort.

For example, you might spend hours tweaking a function to make it run faster, only to realize later that the function isn’t even critical to your application’s performance. Worse yet, you might end up with code that is harder to maintain and debug, all for minimal or no real-world benefits.

---

### Why Premature Optimization is Bad

1. **Wasted Effort**  
   Optimizing code takes time. If you focus on optimizing a piece of code that doesn’t significantly impact your application’s performance, you’re wasting valuable time that could be spent on more important features or bug fixes.

2. **Lack of Progress**  
   If you get too caught up in optimizing every small detail, you might never finish your project. Imagine spending weeks optimizing a single function, only to realize that the rest of your project still needs work. A slow but functional project is better than an unfinished one.

3. **Project Relevance**  
   A single optimized function isn’t going to make your project successful. What matters is having a complete, functional project that solves a problem or meets user needs. No one will care about your highly optimized function if it doesn’t contribute to a larger, working application.

---

### When Should You Optimize?

Optimization is not inherently bad. The key is to optimize at the right time and for the right reasons. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Make It Work Before You Make It Fast**  
   Always prioritize functionality over performance. Focus on getting your code to work correctly before worrying about how fast it runs. Once your project is complete and functional, you can identify areas that truly need optimization.

2. **Optimize Where It Matters**  
   Not all code needs to be optimized. Focus on the parts of your application that are critical to performance, such as loops, database queries, or functions that are called frequently.

3. **Consider the Scale of Your Project**  
   The need for optimization depends on the size and scope of your project. If your code is only used by a small number of people or infrequently, saving a few seconds might not be worth the effort. However, if your code is used by millions of users or runs thousands of times a day, even small optimizations can make a big difference.

---

### Tips and Tricks

- **Use Profiling Tools**: Before optimizing, use profiling tools to identify the bottlenecks in your code. This ensures you’re focusing on the areas that will have the most impact.
- **Keep It Simple**: Don’t overcomplicate your code for the sake of optimization. Simple, readable code is usually easier to maintain and debug.
- **Test Thoroughly**: After making optimizations, always test your code to ensure it still works as expected. Optimization should never come at the cost of functionality.
- **Avoid Over-Optimization**: Optimize only what is necessary. For example, saving a few nanoseconds in a function that is rarely called might not be worth the effort.

---

### Conclusion

Premature optimization can lead to wasted time, unfinished projects, and code that is harder to maintain. Always prioritize functionality and ensure your code works correctly before attempting to optimize it. Use profiling tools to identify true bottlenecks and focus your efforts there. Remember, a slow but functional project is better than an unfinished one. Optimize wisely and only when it truly matters.

# 015 Monkey Patching



## Monkey Patching in Python: A Fun and Effective Technique

Monkey patching in Python is a fascinating and somewhat quirky technique that allows developers to dynamically modify code at runtime. In this section, we'll explore what monkey patching is, why it's useful, and how to use it effectively.

### What is Monkey Patching?

Monkey patching is the process of replacing or modifying code at runtime. This can be done to fix bugs, add new functionality, or even to mock out certain parts of your code for testing purposes. The name "monkey patching" comes from the idea of "monkeying around" with code, making changes on the fly.

### The Problem with Real Requests

When working with libraries like `requests`, making real API calls can be costly and inefficient, especially during testing. For example, if you're testing an API endpoint that charges per request, you could end up wasting money. Here's an example of how you might normally use the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

data = requests.get('https://www.apple.com')
print(data)
```

This code will make a real HTTP request to `https://www.apple.com` and return the response. But what if you want to test this code without making a real request?

### Monkey Patching to the Rescue

Monkey patching allows us to replace the `requests.get` method with our own custom function. This way, we can simulate the response without making a real request. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Define a Custom Function:**

```python
def get(url: str) -> str:
    # Simulate a test response
    return "<Test Response>"
```

2. **Monkey Patch the `requests.get` Method:**

```python
requests.get = get
```

3. **Test Your Monkey Patched Code:**

```python
data = requests.get('https://www.apple.com')
print(data)  # Outputs: Test Response
```

By doing this, you've effectively replaced the real `requests.get` method with your own custom function. Now, when you call `requests.get`, it will return your test response instead of making a real HTTP request.

### Why Use Monkey Patching?

- **Testing:** Monkey patching is incredibly useful for testing. It allows you to isolate your code and test it without relying on external dependencies.
- **Cost Savings:** If you're working with APIs that charge per request, monkey patching can help you avoid unnecessary costs during testing.
- **Flexibility:** Monkey patching gives you the flexibility to modify code behavior at runtime, which can be useful in a variety of scenarios.

### Tips and Tricks

- **Use Monkey Patching Sparingly:** While monkey patching is a powerful tool, it should be used sparingly. Overusing it can make your code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Clearly Document Your Patches:** If you do use monkey patching, make sure to document it clearly so other developers understand what's going on.
- **Test Your Patches:** Always test your monkey patches thoroughly to ensure they're working as expected.
- **Consider Using Mocking Libraries:** For more complex testing scenarios, consider using dedicated mocking libraries like `unittest.mock`, which provide more robust and maintainable solutions.

Monkey patching is a fun and effective technique that can be a valuable addition to your Python toolkit. Whether you're testing code, modifying behavior at runtime, or just experimenting with different functionality, monkey patching can help you get the job done. So next time you're faced with a situation where you need to modify code on the fly, remember: monkey patching might just be the solution you're looking for!

# 016 Custom Exceptions



## Creating Custom Exceptions in Python

In a previous lesson, we explored how to handle exceptions in Python. However, there are times when we need to create our own custom exceptions to better suit our needs. this section will guide you through the process of creating and customizing exceptions in Python.

### Why Custom Exceptions?

Custom exceptions allow us to define specific error conditions that are not covered by Python's built-in exceptions. They make our code more readable and maintainable by providing clear context for errors.

### Basic Setup

To create a custom exception, you need to create a class that inherits from the base `Exception` class. Here’s a basic example:

```python
class NegativeException(Exception):
    pass
```

This is the simplest form of a custom exception. However, it doesn’t provide much functionality. Let’s enhance it.

### Adding Functionality

We can add more functionality by including an initializer and a custom message. Let’s expand our `NegativeException` class:

```python
class NegativeException(Exception):
    """Raised if a value is below zero."""
    
    def __init__(self, number, error_code):
        self.number = number
        self.error_code = error_code
        message = f"{self.number} is less than zero. Error code: {self.error_code}"
        super().__init__(message)
```

In this example:
- We’ve added a docstring to describe the exception.
- The `__init__` method takes `number` and `error_code` as parameters.
- We construct a custom error message using `super().__init__`.

### Using the Custom Exception

Now, let’s see how to use this exception in a `try-except` block:

```python
try:
    raise NegativeException(-5, 999)
except NegativeException as e:
    print(e)
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
-5 is less than zero. Error code: 999
```

### Accessing Attributes

You can access the attributes of the exception for further processing:

```python
try:
    raise NegativeException(-5, 999)
except NegativeException as e:
    print(f"Number: {e.number}")
    print(f"Error Code: {e.error_code}")
```

This will output:

```
Number: -5
Error Code: 999
```

### Adding Custom Methods

You can add custom methods to your exception class for additional functionality:

```python
class NegativeException(Exception):
    """Raised if a value is below zero."""
    
    def __init__(self, number, error_code):
        self.number = number
        self.error_code = error_code
        message = f"{self.number} is less than zero. Error code: {self.error_code}"
        super().__init__(message)
        
    def custom_method(self):
        return f"Custom method: Number {self.number} with error code {self.error_code}"
```

Now you can use the custom method in the `except` block:

```python
try:
    raise NegativeException(-5, 999)
except NegativeException as e:
    print(e.custom_method())
```

This will output:

```
Custom method: Number -5 with error code 999
```

### Serialization with Pickle

If you plan to serialize your exception using the `pickle` module, you need to add the `__reduce__` method:

```python
class NegativeException(Exception):
    """Raised if a value is below zero."""
    
    def __init__(self, number, error_code):
        self.number = number
        self.error_code = error_code
        message = f"{self.number} is less than zero. Error code: {self.error_code}"
        super().__init__(message)
        
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (self.__class__, (self.number, self.error_code))
```

This allows your custom exception to be serialized and deserialized properly.

### Tips and Tricks

1. **Meaningful Names**: Choose a clear and descriptive name for your custom exception. This helps in debugging and understanding the error context.

2. **Include Relevant Data**: Store relevant data as instance variables so they can be accessed later for logging or further processing.

3. **Custom Messages**: Provide clear and descriptive error messages to help developers understand the issue quickly.

4. **Inherit from Exception**: Always inherit your custom exception from the base `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

5. **Add Documentation**: Use docstrings to document your custom exceptions, explaining when and why they are raised.

6. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your custom exceptions in different scenarios to ensure they behave as expected.

7. **Avoid Overuse**: Custom exceptions should be used judiciously. Only create them when they provide clear value to your code.

8. **Consider Serialization**: If you plan to use your exceptions in distributed systems or with serialization, implement the `__reduce__` method.

By following these guidelines and examples, you can create robust and meaningful custom exceptions that enhance the readability and maintainability of your Python code. Custom exceptions are a powerful tool in your Python toolkit, allowing you to define specific error conditions and handle them gracefully.
